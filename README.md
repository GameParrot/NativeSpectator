# NativeSpectator
Pocketmine plugin that makes players in spectator mode use native spectator mode

# Why
Vanilla Pocketmine handles spectator mode by putting the player in creative mode, allowing them to clip through blocks, making them fly, and most events from them are ignored. However, it does not use the native spectator mode in the client (gamemode 6). Using native spectator mode fixes several issues that vanilla pocketmines solution has.
